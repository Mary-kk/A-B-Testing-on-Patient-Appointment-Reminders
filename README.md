# A-B-Testing-on-Patient-Appointment-Reminders

Analysed 100,000+ appointments to assess the impact of SMS reminders on no-show rates, finding an unexpected increase (27.57% vs. 16.70%).

Recommended personalized reminders for younger patients, phone call follow-ups for disabled/medically challenged individuals, and additional reminders for long-scheduled appointments. 

Used Python, and statistical tests (Chi-Square, t-test) for analysis.
